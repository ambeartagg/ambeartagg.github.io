            <p> I am currently a student at Boise State University and am majoring in Games, Interactive Media, and
                Mobile
                technology (GIMM). I am also minoring in Anthropology, as I am very interested in how people interact
                with the world around them. I love learning new skills and expanding my artistic abilities. I am

            <h2>Music Video Rotoscoping</h2>
            <p>In this project, I created an animation for the song New Rose by the Damned. I got to use exciting new
                tools such as Adobe Animate and Premiere Pro, and learned about the difficult, yet fascinating process
                of rotoscoping. It was fun to learn about how old the technique is and how frequently it was used in
                early animation. It was also my first time animating anything, so the entire project was a learning
                experience.</p>

            <h2>Indiana Jones Animation</h2>
            <p>
                Since I was a child I have always loved the Indiana Jones movies, so I wanted to make a tribute piece as
                a project. I created an animated opening credits sequence for the film Raiders of the Lost Ark. This was
                only my second animation, so learning to use the tools provided in Adobe Animate was fun. I also enjoyed
                drawing all of the pieces in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and putting them together.

            <h2>Coffee Shop App Design</h2>
            <p>This was my first time ever designing an application. I liked the designs created by Starbucks and
                similar companies so I took inspiration for my own project. In this experience I learned how to use
                Adobe XD and I learned more about different design principles. It was fun to make everything and put it
                together into a functioning blueprint.</p>
