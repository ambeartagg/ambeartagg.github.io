                <h1>Animated Opening Credits</h1>
                <p>Since I was a child I have always loved the Indiana Jones movies, so I wanted to make a tribute piece
                    as
                    a project. I created an animated opening credits sequence for the film Raiders of the Lost Ark. This
                    was
                    only my second animation, so learning to use the tools provided in Adobe Animate was fun. I also
                    enjoyed
                    drawing all of the pieces in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and putting them together.</p>

            <div class='col-md-8'>
                <h2>The Process</h2>

                <p>Before I could start animating, I needed to make a storyboard to map out what I had planned. I
                    decided to watch the film and draw a quick sketch in Adobe Photoshop of some scenes that stood out
                    to me. From these and a few more I added, I created the storyboard. </p>

                <hr>
                <p>My next step was to create the assets I needed for animation. Using Adobe Illustrator, I created a
                    silhouette of Indiana Jones. I created each limb in a separate layer so I could later manipulate the
                    body while animating. This was helpful for running, walking, and swinging from his whip. After my
                    character model had been finished, I moved onto making each of the background scenes. I drew each of
                    these backdrops in Photoshop. Moving into Adobe Animate, I carefully created each scene by hand.

                    <hr>
                    <p>After piecing together my drawings in Animate and adding animation to each scene, I added the
                        film credit text in Premiere Pro. Even though I had to cut some scenes from my storyboard, I was
                        still very happy with the way my animation turned out. It was an incredibly fun learning
                        experience for me and seeing the finished product was truly great.</p>
