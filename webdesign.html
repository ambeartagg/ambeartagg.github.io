<h2>Music Web Design</h2>
            <p>I had never really made a website prior to this one, and greatly enjoyed learning to use html, css, and
                javascript. It was fun to organize some of my favorite songs in a table I could sort in various ways. I
                loved being able to see my website come alive as I progressed through each step.
