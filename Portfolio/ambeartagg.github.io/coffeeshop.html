<h2>Coffee Shop App Design</h2>
            <p>This was my first time ever designing an application. I liked the designs created by Starbucks and
                similar companies so I took inspiration for my own project. In this experience I learned how to use
                Adobe XD and I learned more about different design principles. It was fun to make everything and put it
                together into a functioning blueprint.</p>
