            <h1>Animated Music Video</h1>
            <p>In this project, I created an animation for the song New Rose by the Damned. I got to use exciting new
                tools such as Adobe Animate and Premiere Pro, and learned about the difficult, yet fascinating process
                of rotoscoping. It was fun to learn about how old the technique is and how frequently it was used in
                early animation. It was also my first time animating anything, so the entire project was a learning
                experience.</p>

            <p>The first thing I did was choose the music video I wanted to trace over for my animation. I considered a
                few different option before ultimately landing on the music video footage of the Damned performing in
                1976. After I made my choice, I took several screenshots of the video and opened up Adobe Photoshop.
                There, I began practicing tracing over the images until I formed a storyboard for my project.</p>

            <p>After completing my storyboard, I moved onto animation. As I worked I focused on trying to make sure
                I captured the fast paced feeling of the music. I traced the video frame by frame, making sure to
                capture details, while still opting for a more scratchy aesthetic to the art.</p>

                <p>After drawing over 900 individual frames, my project was complete. I spent many sleepless nights
                    working on this project for class, and although I did not reach the length of video I wanted, I am
                    still proud of what I did manage to accomplish for my first time.</p>
