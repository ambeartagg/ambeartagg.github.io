                I had never really made a website prior to this one, and greatly enjoyed learning to use HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript. I wanted a way to organize some of my music, so I created a large data table with various filters. 
                After sorting through some of my favorite songs, I picked about 100 that I really liked and added them to the table. 
                I also included information about them such as artist, genre, year released, and length.

            <p>
                In addition to my data table, I created three graphs. Two of the graphs were created using D3.js, and the third 
                was much simpler. These graphs helped me better understand my music taste, providing data visualizations for the 
                most common era of music I listen to and the most popular genres.

                This project was a fun way to organize my favorite songs and bring my website to life. I loved seeing my progress as I worked 
                through each step. You can check out the final version of my website below!
