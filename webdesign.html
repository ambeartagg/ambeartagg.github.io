    <h1>Mobile Narrative Web Design</h1>
    <p>I had never really made a website prior to this one, and greatly enjoyed learning to use html, css, and
        javascript. I wanted a way to organise some of my music, so I created a large data table with various filters.
        After sorting through some of my favorite songs, I picked about 100 that I really liked and added them to the
        table. I
        also included information about them such as artist, genre, year released, and length. In addition to my data
        table, I created three graphs. Two of the graphs were created using D3.js. The other was much more simple. These
        graphs were helpful in learning about my music taste. They provided easy data visualization for things like the
        most common era of music I listened to and the most common genre I listen to. Overall, it was fun to organize
        some of my favorite songs. I loved being able to see my website come alive as I progressed through each step.
