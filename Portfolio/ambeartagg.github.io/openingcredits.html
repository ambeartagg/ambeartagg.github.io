<h2>Indiana Jones Animation</h2>
            <p>
                Since I was a child I have always loved the Indiana Jones movies, so I wanted to make a tribute piece as
                a project. I created an animated opening credits sequence for the film Raiders of the Lost Ark. This was
                only my second animation, so learning to use the tools provided in Adobe Animate was fun. I also enjoyed
                drawing all of the pieces in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and putting them together.
